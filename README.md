## 📌 Project Description

Our project, **An Accurate and Trustworthy Chatbot for Data Interactions**, enables government agencies to interact with complex datasets through a conversational AI interface.  

Unlike typical AI systems that prioritize reasoning, our solution takes an **accuracy-first approach**. It integrates multiple government datasets, applies trust scoring and validation mechanisms, and provides transparent audit trails. This ensures reliability, eliminates hallucinations, and meets the high standards of accountability required in government decision-making.

## 🤖 AI Government Assistant

The AI Chat interface allows users to ask natural language questions about Australian government budgets, departments, and policies.  
Our hybrid AI system supports **SQL analysis, RAG document retrieval, and combined hybrid analysis** to ensure accurate, transparent, and auditable answers.  
An **Evidence Package** is generated for each response to validate data sources.

## 🔍 Smart Government Data Query

The AI Query page provides an advanced query interface where users can choose between:  
- **SQL Numerical Analysis**  
- **RAG Document Retrieval**  
- **Hybrid Combined Analysis**  

Users can ask questions such as *"What is the education budget for 2024?"* or *"Show me vendor payment outliers"*.  
Each query generates a full **audit trail** and an **evidence package** to ensure transparency.
